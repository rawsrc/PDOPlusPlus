# PDOPlusPlus : a new generation of PDO Wrapper

`2021-11-01` `PHP 8.0+` `v.4.0.0`

## TESTS

To run the tests yourself, you need to install/copy in `vendor/exacodis` 
directory the [Exacodis, a minimalist test engine for PHP](https://github.com/rawsrc/exacodis)

Then, define 2 distinct database users:
- root
- user_test
Check [connections.php](https://github.com/rawsrc/PDOPlusPlus/tree/master/tests/connections.php) for the passwords

Once everything is done, call the file `test.php`.

Here's the result: [Global test result](https://github.com/rawsrc/PDOPlusPlus/tree/master/tests/result_page.html)
